## 🌱 How to start this project

Follow these instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on the [Machine Learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template) [by clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate).
2. Open the newly created repository in Codespace using the [Codespace button extension](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).
3. Once the Codespace's VSCode has finished opening, start your project by following the instructions below.

## 📝 Instructions

### Wine Classifier with KNN

Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. Could AI help you choose a sommelier-worthy wine?

We will use the following red wine dataset extracted from [Wine Quality Data Set - UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosinni/k-nearest-neighbors-project-tutorial/refs/heads/main/winequality-red.csv
```

#### Column Description

Each row represents a wine. The columns describe its chemical composition:

- fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid

- residual sugar, chlorides

- free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide

- density, pH, sulphates, alcohol

The target column is **label**:

- 0 = Low quality

- 1 = Medium quality

- 2 = High quality

### Let's get started! 😎

1. **Load the data.** Load the CSV with Pandas and explore its structure.
2. **Train the KNN model:**
    - Separate the independent variables (X) from the target (y).

    - Split into training and testing sets (80/20).

    - Scale the data if necessary (highly recommended with KNN!).

    - Train the model with an initial k value.

3. Evaluate performance using:

    - `accuracy_score`

    - `confusion_matrix`

    - `classification_report`

4. **Optimize k.** Create a loop to test different k values (e.g., from 1 to 20).

    - Save the results in a list.

    - Plot accuracy vs k to find the best value.

## Feeling confident?

Create a function that takes numerical values and predicts the quality:

```python
predict_wine_quality([7.4, 0.7, 0.0, 1.9, 0.076, 11.0, 34.0, 0.9978, 3.51, 0.56, 9.4])
>>> "This wine is likely of medium quality 🍷"
```

> Note: We also provide solution samples in `./solution.ipynb`, which we honestly suggest you only use if you're stuck for more than 30 minutes or if you've already finished and want to compare it with your approach.

## 🚛 How to deliver this project
